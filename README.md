# UART-Communication---Verilog
Verilog code created by Hugo Rodrigues (Under Test)

This code was written in Verilog Language to program a CPLD* / FPGA** device for a UART Communication. The purpose of it is to replace the microcontroller PIC18F4550 of a Landing Gear Control System with a CPLD / FPGA device. Only 3 pins are required on the CPLD / FPGA device (Tx, Rx, and Clock) to achieve the communication. 
This code is still under tests and improvements.

* CPLD – Complex Programmable Logic Device
** FPGA – Field Programmable Gate Array
